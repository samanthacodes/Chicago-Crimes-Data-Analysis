# Chicago-Crimes-Data-Analysis
This repository contains an end-to-end Data Engineering and Analysis project focusing on the crimes data from the city of Chicago. The project includes data loading, manipulation, and visualization using various technologies such as HDFS, Hive, Python, and HTML. Below is a summary of the project's key tasks:

Data Loading â€“ HDFS, Hive:

Loaded crimes data directly from the city of Chicago data portal and stored it in HDFS.
Created an external Hive table called chicago_crimes in a specified database.
Loaded data from the crimes CSV into the chicago_crimes Hive table.

Data Manipulation - Hive:
Identified the earliest and most recent dates of recorded crimes and listed the types of those crimes.
Listed the top 5 and bottom 5 primary crime types based on the total count of occurrences.
Determined the location description with the highest number of homicides.
Identified the most dangerous and least dangerous police districts in the Chicago area.
Calculated the average number of assaults per month in 2019 and compared it to the previous period.

Python Visualization in HTML:
Created a summarized external table in Hive for further analysis.

Visualized data analysis results using Python and HTML files.
The project provides valuable insights into Chicago crime data and demonstrates proficiency in data engineering, manipulation, and visualization using SQL, Hive, and Python.
